// host_targeting.go is the engine's implementation of effects.HostTargeting's
// target offer (rules-engine refactor spec W1d), with the coarse ValidTgts$
// shape reads the offer and target legality share.

// LegalTargets satisfies effects.Host for target-changing effects. It exposes
// the same census used by cast and trigger target decisions, so a redirect
// cannot bypass protection, CantTarget, stack-kind, zone, or filter legality.
//
// The census runs with the RESOLVING stack object as both source and
// excludeSelf whenever one exists -- exactly the placement ask's own call
// (pushTrigger -> askTarget passes the stack object id): CR 115.5 withholds
// the ability on the stack from targeting itself, never its source permanent,
// so a trigger whose source is a legal target may target it (Kor Outfitter's
// Attach sub attaches to Kor Outfitter). A direct, off-stack resolution (no
// resolving object) keeps the caller's source.
