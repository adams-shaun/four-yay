// engineResolution groups the Engine's in-flight resolution context, its
// LKI/answer-cursor maps and the replacement windows. It is embedded by
// value in Engine (rules/engine_struct.go), so every field keeps its
// documented contract comment and every existing e.<field> access keeps
// compiling unchanged through Go's field promotion. Clone's per-field copy
// classes (rules/clone.go) are unchanged by the move.
type engineResolution struct {
	// resolutionCtx is the live Ctx of the Resolve chain whose effect is
	// CURRENTLY running, published by effects.Resolve through the optional
	// resolutionCtxHost interface around the whole chain and restored on
	// return. Read by the tape seams (unless payment, Ward, Play) and the
	// departing-target snapshots. Transient scratch: rebuilt identically by
	// replay, nil outside a chain (combat, mulligan and other non-resolution
	// asks).

	// exploitedLKI maps an EXPLOITED creature's object id to the LKI snapshot
	// of it at the instant it was sacrificed to pay an exploit (CR 702.58a),
	// published by effects/exploit.go through Host.RememberExploitedLKI while
	// the resolving marker holds Ctx.Sacrificed. The events.Exploit marker
	// carries only the exploited id, and Move has already cleared the
	// creature's counters and battlefield layers by emit time, so this map is
	// what lets a trig:Exploited body read TriggeredExploited$CardPower/
	// CardToughness as last-known information (rules' attachExploitedLKI).
	// Engine-only and replay-derived like the other LKI maps: replay re-runs
	// the same effect resolution, so it repopulates identically, and the entry
	// is removed when the exploited object leaves a zone.

	// sacrificed as its own activation cost, refreshed for already-stacked and
	// pending abilities when their source later departs, cloned at intent
	// boundaries, and removed with the stack object. Resolution copies it into
	// effects.Ctx; effects uses it only when the source is no longer live.
