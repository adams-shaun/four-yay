# Runtime behavior notes

Detailed runtime and host behavior notes moved out of the always-loaded `AGENTS.md` to keep agent context bounded. These are load-bearing behavior constraints; consult this page when working in the named areas.

## Trigger-relative filter arguments (pg2)

`ControlledBy <ref>` and `OwnedBy <ref>` recognise exactly `TriggeredTarget`,
`TriggeredDefendingPlayer`, `TriggeredPlayer` and `TriggeredCard`, plus a
`Spawner> <known-inner-ref>` chain in that argument position (resolved
against the same riding TriggerContext); an absent binding fails closed
(also under `!`); the `Targeted*` family stays unknown, as does every
`Spawner>` chain outside that argument position. `effects.TriggerContext` carries event roles separately from the
resolving ability's source, targets and Remembered, survives suspension,
cloning and stack copying, and is rebuilt by replay without new events. Not
implemented: `TargetingPlayer$` (Magus of the Abyss asks the trigger
controller), LKI owner/control snapshots for a referent that changes before
resolution (live owner/controller is read), carrying these bindings into a
registered continuous effect, and the Self/Other target-source normalisation
(Flickerwisp's `Permanent.Other`).

## Cast-provenance filter arguments (castprov1/2/3 + wascastfrom)

The `Card.wasCast*` family is a rules-side split, not a filter predicate:
`castProvenanceAdmits` (`rules/cast_provenance.go`) strips the tokens and reads
the log (latest PutOnStack cast wins; a copy was never cast; a never-cast card
reads false). Hand family: `wasCastFromYourHandByYou`, `wasCastByYou`,
`wasCastFromYourHand`. Origin-zone family: `wasCastFromExile`,
`wasCastFromYourGraveyard` and `...ByYou` (identical here: a cast's origin zone
is always the caster's), `wasCastFromTheirHand`. Bare `wasCastFromGraveyard`
is the effects-side CastFlags predicate (flashback/harmonize/escape) instead.
Wired at the trigger match walks, `Count$ThisTurnCast_<spec>`,
`Count$wasCastFromExile`, the target walks (offer and CR 608.2b recheck) and
the CantBeCast walk (`castOriginAdmitsAtZone` reads the pending cast's
origin). Still open: the tokens are not evaluated by effects' own
ConditionPresent/ConditionDefined evaluator (such a gate runs its sub
unconditionally), there is no `Count$wasCastFromYourGraveyard` head, and the
may-play provenance predicates (`MayPlaySource`/`CastSa`) stay fail-closed
(see the ValidLKI row in `AGENTS.md`'s Known approximations register).

## Host behaviour notes (embedder observer hooks, D15)

`OnBurst` errors crash the match like a persist failure (D15): the table
halts and the chain does not continue. `OnMatchEnd` errors are discarded
because the outcome is already recorded and an error cannot un-record it, so
an embedder that persists through `OnMatchEnd` must handle its own
persistence failures inside the callback.

## Seat-privacy boundary

A seat credential names **both its table and seat**. Every current
seat-authorised HTTP route (`view`, `events`, `pending`, `intent`, `undo`)
goes through `host/httpapi`'s `claimForTable`; a mismatched or legacy unbound
claim is 403 and must never reach registry state. `cmd/gorged` mints startup
and vs-bot tokens with that pair, so after deployment old tokens stop working;
the web client returns a rejected stale join to the lobby, where it obtains a
fresh game claim. Stream session ids are random 128-bit values issued only in
`hello`; `host.Session.serial`, not the public id, preserves fan-out order.
